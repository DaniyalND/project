   <section class="terms-conditions">
        <h4> Payments </h4>
        <p class="para-spacing"> Appointments must be secured with a credit card. We will pre-authorize the estimated charges 
            to guarantee transparency. In the event that additional hours are required for your services, 
            we will calculate and adjust these accordingly on your invoice, with the corresponding amount charged to your card. 
            Your convenience is our priority! We accept Mastercard, Visa and American Express.
             We do not take payments via check, cash or money order. 
        </p>

        <h4> Tipping </h4>
        <p class="para-spacing"> 
            While tipping is not mandatory, we truly appreciate it for the services we provide. 
            You can choose to show your gratitude to your Residential Specialist by leaving a tip 
            at the end of their cleaning session or by adding it to your final bill.
        </p>


        <h4> Access to your home </h4>
        <p class="para-spacing"> 
            Our standard procedure aims to safeguard your home and belongings, and as such, 
            we do not store or keep keys. We strongly recommend using an external lockbox with a code, 
            readily available at most hardware stores. You can include access codes in your 
            online booking. If you have a "hidden" key or intend to leave one, kindly add this 
            information to your booking so that your cleaning team is aware of its location.
        </p>




        
        <h4> Lock outs </h4>
        <p class="para-spacing"> 
            In the event that our cleaning teams encounter difficulty gaining access to your 
            home upon arrival, we will promptly reach out to you through phone or text message. 
            This allows us to address any access-related issues and proceed with your scheduled 
            appointment. We will wait for a response for 15 minutes. Please note that failure to respond within 
            this timeframe may result in the cancellation of your appointment and appropriate cancellation fees may apply.
        </p>




        <h4> Health & Safety </h4>
        <p class="para-spacing"> 
            Our health and safety policies prevent us from cleaning under the following conditions: mold, recent covid diagnosis. 
              
        

        </p>


        <h4> Cancellations </h4>
        <p class="para-spacing"> 
            We acknowledge that unforeseen cancellations can occur due to unexpected circumstances. 
            The following guidelines have been established for all cancellations: a 24-hour notice is required for all cancellations or reschedules without penalty, there is a $50.00 cancellation fee for cancellations made with less than 24 hours notice.
              
            <br>
            <br>
            If Clean & Sweep needs to reschedule due to cleaning team illness or extreme weather, we will contact you as soon as possible to reschedule your appointment for the next available slot.
        </p>

        <h4> Scheduled Appointments </h4>
        <p class="para-spacing"> 
            Appointment reminders are automatically sent via text message one day prior to your appointment, giving you time to reschedule if needed.        </p>
        </p>   



        <h4> Pets </h4>
        <p class="para-spacing"> 
            To ensure the safety of your pets during our scheduled cleaning time, please keep them in a secure area. We cannot assume responsibility for any unexpected escapes. Please inform your booking agent or add a note to your booking so that we are aware and take all necessary precautions to ensure they stay safe with us. 
            Your pet's safety is our priority!
        </p>   

        <h4>Cancellation for Unsafe Environments </h4>
        <p class="para-spacing"> 
            We reserve the right to cancel a cleaning appointment if we deem the environment to be unsafe upon arrival.
            This precautionary measure is in place to ensure the well-being of our dedicated staff members. 
            We appreciate your understanding and cooperation in maintaining a secure and healthy working environment for everyone involved.
        </p>   


        <h4> Incident Reporting </h4>
        <p class="para-spacing"> 
            We encourage our clients to promptly report any incidents, unsafe conditions, or injuries to our staff. 
            Timely reporting plays a crucial role in ensuring the safety of both our staff and the property we are responsible for. 
            Your vigilance and cooperation are greatly appreciated in maintaining a secure environment for everyone involved.
